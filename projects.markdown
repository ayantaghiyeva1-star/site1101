      Here are some of the projects I've worked on during my first year. Each one taught me something new about engineering, technology, and sharing knowledge with others.

        <h2>Basic Logic Gates</h2>
        <p>
          Built and tested basic logic gates (NOT, AND, OR) as part of a hardware-focused course project. 
          I learned how these fundamental building blocks work at the circuit level and how they combine 
          to create more complex digital systems. This project helped me understand the foundation of 
          digital electronics and how computers process information.

        <h2>Hour of Code / Hour of AI</h2>
        <p>
          Participated in and helped organize an Hour of Code and Hour of AI activity focused on teaching 
          basic computing concepts to others. This experience taught me how to break down complex ideas 
          into simple, understandable steps and how to communicate technical concepts clearly. It was 
          rewarding to see others get excited about coding and technology.
