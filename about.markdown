    <h1>Learning, experimenting, and building my way into product and technology.</h1>
    <p class="about-intro">
      I'm a first-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering student at ADA University.
      I enjoy looking at how things work behind the scenes and how people actually use them in real life.

      <p>
        Right now, I'm in the early stages of my journey — taking in as much as I can from classes, side projects,
        and anything that lets me connect engineering with design. I am especially curious about how hardware,
        software, and interfaces come together to shape the experiences we use every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy breaking ideas down, sketching them out, and then slowly improving them through feedback and
        iteration. My goal is to keep learning new tools, understand the basics really well, and build a solid
        foundation I can grow from over the next few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio is a small space where I share what I am working on, what I am learning, and how my thinking
        changes over time as I explore both engineering and product design.

      <h2>Things I’m currently excited about</h2>
      <p>
        These are some of the areas I keep coming back to when I read, experiment, or start a new project.
        They might change as I grow, but for now they guide what I choose to learn next.

          <h3>Human‑centered interfaces</h3>
          <p>
            Exploring how layout, typography, and interaction patterns can make digital products feel calmer,
            clearer, and easier to use — even for complex ideas.
