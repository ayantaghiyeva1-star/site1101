    <h1>Learning, experimenting, and building my way into product and technology.</h1>
    <p class="about-intro">
      I'm Ayan Taghiyeva, a first-year Electrical and Electronic Engineering (BSEEE) student at ADA University.
      I enjoy looking at how things work behind the scenes and how people actually use them in real life.
    </p>

      <p>
        Right now, I'm in the early stages of my journey — taking in as much as I can from classes, side projects,
        and volunteering. I am especially curious about how hardware, software, and real people come together to
        shape the experiences we use every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        I enjoy breaking ideas down, asking questions, and then slowly improving my understanding through practice
        and feedback. My goal during my bachelor’s degree is to build a strong technical background while also
        improving my soft skills, like communication, teamwork, and leadership.
      </p>
      <p>
        Volunteering is also an important part of my life — it lets me contribute to my community, meet new people,
        and grow my confidence. This portfolio is a small space where I share what I am working on, what I am
        learning, and how my thinking changes over time as I explore both engineering and technology in general.

      <h2>Things I’m currently excited about</h2>
      <p>
        These are some of the areas I keep coming back to when I read, experiment, or start a new project.
        They might change as I grow, but for now they guide what I choose to learn next.

          <p>

            Playing piano helps me relax, focus, and think more creatively. I like seeing how consistent practice
            slowly turns difficult pieces into something that feels natural.
